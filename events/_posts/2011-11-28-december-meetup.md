The December NodeDC meetup will be on **Wednesday, December 14 at 7:00 pm**. We'll kick things off at 7:30 pm with introductions, followed by five minute lightning talks on topics related to node.js. We are looking for volunteers to give talks. If you're interested, send your topic to [@nodedc](http://twitter.com/nodedc) and we'll get you on the lineup, which we'll post here as it solidifies.

The meetup will be at the upstairs bar of [Stetson's](http://stetsons-dc.com/) again, located right of 16th and U streets NW. Both the Dupont Circle metro stop on the red line and U street on the green line are about four blocks away, with 16th street buses all passing within a block of the bar.

Hope to see you there!
